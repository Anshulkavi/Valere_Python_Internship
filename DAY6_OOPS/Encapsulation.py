'''
What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation means:

Wrapping data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class), while hiding the internal details from outside interference.

In simple terms:

You protect your data.

You provide controlled access via methods.

âœ… Levels of Access in Python
Access       Level	    Syntax	Description
Public	    self.var	Accessible everywhere
Protected	self._var	Suggests "use only inside class or subclass"
Private	    self.__var	Name mangled, not directly accessible
