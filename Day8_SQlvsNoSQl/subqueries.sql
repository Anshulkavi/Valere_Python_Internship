'''Subqueries â€” Query inside a query
A subquery lets you:

Filter using results from another query

Compare a value to a group

Do powerful conditional logic'''

-- # Show all students who are in a course with the maximum number of credits.

-- FROM students s   
-- JOIN courses c ON s.course = c.name
-- WHERE c.credits = (
--     SELECT MAX(credits) FROM courses

-- # Show all courses where the number of students is above average.
-- Nested subquery gets average students per course; outer filters above it.
